# Spaceship Titanic: Passenger Transport Prediction

## Mission Overview
Your mission is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with a spacetime anomaly. Using recovered personal records, you are to build a predictive model to assist rescue crews in locating and retrieving the missing passengers.

## Project Overview
You will analyze personal records of Spaceship Titanic passengers to identify patterns and features that correlate with the transport event. This involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a machine learning model for classification.

## Learning Outcomes
- Develop skills in data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- Gain experience in building and evaluating machine learning models for classification.
- Apply feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
- Enhance problem-solving and analytical skills in a simulated real-world scenario.

## Project Requirements

### Data Analysis and Modeling
1. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understand the dataset and its structure.
   - Identify patterns and correlations.

2. **Preprocess the Data**
   - Handle missing values appropriately.
   - Encode categorical variables for model input.

3. **Build and Train a Machine Learning Model**
   - Use classification techniques to predict the 'Transported' status.
   - Apply feature engineering to enhance model performance.

4. **Evaluate Model Performance**
   - Use appropriate metrics to assess the accuracy and robustness of the model.

### Technical Requirements
- Use Python programming language and relevant libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn) for data analysis and modeling.
- Ensure code is well-structured, documented, and follows best practices.
- Submit your solution in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) showcasing your analysis, model building process, and evaluation.

## File and Data Field Descriptions
- **PassengerId**: A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is traveling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.
- **HomePlanet**: The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.
- **CryoSleep**: Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.
- **Cabin**: The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.
- **Destination**: The planet the passenger will be debarking to.
- **Age**: The age of the passenger.
- **VIP**: Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.
- **RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck**: Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.
- **Name**: The first and last names of the passenger.
- **Transported**: Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.
## Conclusion
This project involves building a predictive model to identify transported passengers based on their personal records. By following the steps outlined above, you will gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning model development.
